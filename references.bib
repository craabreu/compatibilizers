Major changes and Key Features in content include: Expansion of existing sections on simulation methods, liquid-vapour coexistence, the hierarchical reference theory of criticality, and the dynamics of super-cooled liquids. New sections on binary fluid mixtures, surface tension, wetting, the asymptotic decay of pair correlations, fluids in porous media, the thermodynamics of glasses, and fluid flow at solid surfaces. An entirely new chapter on applications to 'soft matter' of a combination of liquid state theory and coarse graining strategies, with sections on polymer solutions and polymer melts, colloidal dispersions, colloid-polymer mixtures, lyotropic liquid crystals, colloidal dynamics, and on clustering and gelation.

    abstract = {Stochastic modeling constitutes a powerful technique to obtain complete distributions of microstructural properties of polymer materials and may help to synthesize polymers with well-defined microstructure, as in the case of controlled radical polymerizations (CRP). However, these techniques have been often applied to describe polymerizations performed in batch or idealized continuous plug flow conditions. The present manuscript describes a Monte Carlo technique that can be used to calculate microstructural properties in polymerization systems performed continuously with arbitrary residence time distributions (RTD), under regime of complete micromixing segregation. The technique approximates the continuous system by a set of batch reactors, operated independently, whose volumes and batch times can be related to the discretized version of the RTD. The technique is applied successfully to describe a styrene-based CRP reaction carried out in an ideal continuous stirred tank reactor and a tubular non-ideal tubular reactor.},

    abstract = {Polymer materials are normally constituted by chains of different sizes and compositions due to the stochastic nature of most polymerization mechanisms. For this reason, dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations are carried out in the present work to investigate the effect of chain length distribution (CLD), chemical composition distribution (CCD), and block length distribution (BLD) on the process of self-assembly of diblock copolymers. Flory and Poisson distributions are used to study CLD and BLD effects and bidispersed distributions are used for the study of CCD effects. Visual inspection and the static structure factor S(q) are used to evaluate the obtained structures. The results show that high dispersion in the CCD and different levels of dispersion in the BLDs of different components of the system increase the sizes of the segregated domains and decisively affect the structure and the purity of the formed mesophases.},
